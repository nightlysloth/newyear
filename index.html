            <h2 class="cursive">Dear Swara,</h2>
            <p>As I sit here thinking about how to end this year, my mind keeps going back to March. That’s when everything changed for the better. Looking back, this year has been a complete journey—full of ups and downs, loud laughter, and those quiet challenges that we handled together.</p>
            <p>What I love most is that we didn’t just have a "good year," we had a real one. We grew, we learned about each other, and we built something that makes me feel incredibly lucky every day. Ending 2025 with you is the only way I’d want to close this chapter.</p>
            <p>As the clock resets, I want you to know that I’m not just looking forward to the celebration tonight, but to the thousands of tiny moments we’ll share in 2026. Here’s to us, our love, and every beautiful memory waiting for us just around the corner.</p>
            <p class="cursive signature">Love you endlessly,<br>Prateek 💖</p>
